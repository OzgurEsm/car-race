A simple car game wehre you try to avoid a collision!.
Press 'a' or 'left arrow key' to move left, 'd' or 'right arrow key' to move right, 'w' or 'up arrow key' to increase your speed.  
Good luck!  

Thanks to [MariyaSha:Python Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-QOtdD3qx4&t=46s) channel for the guide, and [original code](https://github.com/MariyaSha/SimpleCarGame).  
Next step will be adding a little menu and some updates on screen.
